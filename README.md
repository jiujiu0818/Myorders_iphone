# Myorders_iphone

It's an app that is similar to the combination of yelp and ordering system. People can find restaurants and order the things they want by electronic menu on this app. This system is divided by 3 parts: the server, the iPhone app (used by costumer), the iPad app (used by restaurant). When the costumer finish ordering, the restaurant will get the order thing immediately and cook it. The electronic menu can be edited on the iPad app.

It's based on IOS platform using objective-c and maintained the data persistence with SQLite.The server is implemented by PHP and MySQL with REST-style; Used Rest-Kit to communicate between the
client and the server in JSON.

The ipad app is here:https://github.com/jiujiu0818/Myorders_pad
